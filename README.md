# Primary Dual Hybrid Gradient Algorithm for Convex Optimization Problems

    The Primary Dual Hybrid Gradient Algorithm (PDHG) is demonstrated by solving a two player game for advantageous positions for each 
    player.  This same algorithm would work with two different scoring matrices as long as a move has a loss for one and a gain for another
    player.  This is a central idea behind game theory.
